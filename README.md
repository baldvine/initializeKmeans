# Initialization methods for the k-means clustering algorithm

Simple shiny app to visualize several initialization methods for the k-means algorithm.

The dataset is the ruspini dataset (from the *cluster* package), which has 4 distinct clusters. We visualize four initialization methods:

- "Random": asd
- "KA method": asdf
- "Extreme": jkl
- "k-means++": asdf
